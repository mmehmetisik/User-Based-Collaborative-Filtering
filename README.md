# User-Based-Collaborative-Filtering

# Business Problem
- An online movie streaming platform wants to enhance its existing recommendation system to provide users with MORE PERSONALIZATION.
- The company has already experimented with content-based recommendation systems and item-based recommendation systems, where recommendations are made based on similar likings of movies.
  However, they now aim to further customize the recommendations by emphasizing the similarity between users.
- "Recommendations have been made for films based on similar liking structures, but it is important to further customise these general recommendations based on the similarity of users to users.

# Dataset Story
- It contains films and the ratings given to these films.
- The data set contains about 2000000 ratings for about 27000 films.
  # The dataset consists of two csv files
    # 1st csv file: film.csv file
      - movield: Unique film number
      - title: Film name
    # 2nd csv file : rating.csv file
      - userid = Unique user number.
      - movield = Unique film number
      - rating = Rating given to the film by the user
      - timestamp = Evaluation date
  
# Road Map
1- Preparation of Data Set
2- Determining the Films Watched by the User to be Suggested
3- Accessing the Data and Ids of Other Users Watching the Same Films
4- Determining the Users with the Most Similar Behaviour to the User to be Suggested
5- Calculation of Weighted Average Recommendation Score
6- Preparation of Study Script
